powertrace-help:
	@echo Contiki powertrace is a tool that helps with collecting power data
	@echo from motes. The data can be collected from a testbed or from a Cooja
	@echo simulation. The powertrace data consists of lines of text that include
	@echo the capital letter P followed by a list of numbers that contain the
	@echo measured time that mote peripherals were switched on.
	@echo 
	@echo A powertrace data file can be parsed and plotted with build-in
	@echo powertrace scripts.
	@echo 
	@echo To parse a data file with powertrace data, run:
	@echo 
	@echo   make powertrace-parse LOG=logfile
	@echo 
	@echo to plot the parsed data, do:
	@echo 
	@echo   make powertrace-plot
	@echo 
	@echo this produces two files called powertrace-power.eps and
	@echo powertrace-node-power.eps. To show these files, run:
	@echo 
	@echo   make powertrace-show
	@echo 
	@echo For convenience, all three above make targets can be combined into
	@echo one:
	@echo 
	@echo   make powertrace-all LOG=logfile
	@echo
